            <p className="about-description">
              The Hulede Foundation Scholarship is a program for "brilliant but
              needy" Ghanaian students, primarily at KNUST (Kwame Nkrumah
              University of Science and Technology), aiming to create
              opportunities for the underprivileged in society to improve their
              lives. <br />
              The foundation was established by the sons of Patrick Hulede to
              honor their father and supports students in their first, second,
              and third years through a fully-funded program.
              <br />
              This Scholarship is mainly for Ghanaian students, particularly at
              KNUST, who are both academically strong (brilliant) and
              financially disadvantaged (needy).

              After conducting an investigation, I discovered that the students
